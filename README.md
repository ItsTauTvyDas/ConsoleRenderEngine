# Console Renderer Engine
Old project from 3 years ago or so and decided to public it.

## Examples
They reside in separate project "Examples".

* Fully functional snake game (play with arrow keys).
  * Apple generation is random so no idea what happens when apple tries to spawn inside snake's pixel.
* Unplayable and unfinished tetris game (pieces do fall but that's it).
